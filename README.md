# hello-world

Hi, my name is Ming, when I think about how many things remain to be done, I feel depressed.
Then I choose to do nothing, or simply do things ramdonly but finish nothing, either way, end 
up with nothing. I want to make changes of myself, want to feel good about myself, and want
to things step by step, I know this github cannot help me with that, only myself can save myself.
